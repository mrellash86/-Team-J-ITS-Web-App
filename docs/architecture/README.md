# Architecture Documentation for Team J IT Services

This directory contains architecture diagrams and documentation for the Team J IT Services application.

## System Architecture

The application follows a serverless architecture pattern using AWS services:

1. **Frontend**:
   - Static website hosted on Amazon S3
   - CloudFront distribution for content delivery

2. **Backend**:
   - API Gateway for handling HTTP requests
   - Lambda functions for serverless compute
   - DynamoDB for NoSQL data storage

3. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - GitHub Actions for continuous integration
   - AWS CodeDeploy for deployment automation

## Diagrams

The following diagrams will be included in this directory:

- `system-overview.png` - High-level system architecture
- `api-flow.png` - API request/response flow
- `data-model.png` - Database schema and relationships
- `deployment-pipeline.png` - CI/CD workflow

## Security Considerations

- API Gateway authentication and authorization
- IAM roles with least privilege principle
- S3 bucket policies for secure content delivery
- CORS configuration for API endpoints

## Scalability

- Lambda auto-scaling for backend processing
- DynamoDB on-demand capacity mode
- CloudFront edge caching for improved performance

## Note

This is a placeholder for the actual architecture documentation that will be created during development.
